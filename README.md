# Classifying-Disease-using-Deep-Learning
To classify 133 images into 4 classes  (Healthy, COVID-19, Bacterial Pneumonia, and Viral  Pneumonia) by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

*   AI/ML/DL has been revolutionizing healthcare and medicine:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.   Medical imagery<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.   Drug research<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Genome development

*   Deep learning has been proven to be superior in detecting and classifying disease using imagery data.

*   Skin cancer could be detected more accurately by deep learning that by dermatologists (2018)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.   Human darmatologists detection = 86.6%<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.   Deep learning detection = 95%

# Covid-19_and_Pneumonia_X-Ray_Detector
Aim of this project is to detect Covid-19 from X-ray and also able to differentitate Covid-19 from viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia. I have created a custom dataset that contains covid-19 x-ray images, viral pneumonia x-ray images, bacterial pneumonia x-ray iamges and normal person x-ray images.Each class contains 133 images.

## Dataset

I have used data from https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset and https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. 

0 - Covid-19

1 - Normal X-ray

2 - Viral Pneumonia X-ray

3 - Bacterial Pneumonia X-ray
